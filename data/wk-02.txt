Why is there such a high divorce rate in our Muslim communities? Why do have so many issues with our youth today? Why is it that these issues are not getting resolved? The one answer to these question is that we don’t have a proper understanding of what marriage is all about. We don’t know the rights and responsibilities of a husband and wife towards each other, or we don’t care about them. If a husband and wife are not happy and content with other. If they don’t have a happy marriage, it is unlikely that they would have a happy and healthy family. This workshop is designed to address these issues and teach ways of bringing happiness back into the marriages and raising healthy families.</p><p>Learning Objectives:</p><p>1.

Marital problems begin very early in the marriage. And young single mothers with small children without any support system are not uncommon.</p><p>This workshop is designed to:</p><p>1.

Many of our parents suffer from the stress of finding the ‘right’ spouses for their children. They assume the sole responsibility of finding the spouses and getting them married. Living in a western country away from their extended families and support system, and raising their children who are often quite westernized, doubles the stress. Then, there are some parents who try to find spouses for their children in the same ways spouses were found for them by their parents in their homeland. This often resuslts in major issues between them and their children and the extended families back home.</p><p>The objectives of this workshop are to:</p><p>1. Discuss the parents’ role in facilititating their children’s marriages.<br> 2. Provide an opportunity for the parents to share their values in this regard.<br> 3. Help them realize that the sustomay ways of finding spouses back home no longer are effective or even workable here and now, and<br> 4.

Often, when these problems are allowed to go on without any resolution, they will ultimately close up the hearts and break the emotional bond between spouses and lead to a breakdown of marriage. Once the emotional bond is broken, love disappears and bitterness towards each other flourishes. It is very difficult to rebuild this bond at this stage.</p><p>This workshop is intended to help the couples:</p><p>1. Realize that problems are a normal part of all relationships.<br> 2.
