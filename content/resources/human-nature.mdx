      • What is a human being all about?

      • Where did he come from?

      • What is the purpose of his life?

      • Why is he here on this planet?

      • How long is he going to stay here?

      • Where does he go from here?

      • How is he different from other creatures on this earth?

      • What is he made up of?

      • What are his capabilities/strengths?

      • What are his limitations/weaknesses?

      • Are they all the same. If no, what makes them different from each other?

      • Why does he behave and emote the way he does?

      • What motivates him?

      • Is his behavior predetermined or is he free to behave the way he wants.

      • What makes him good-bad, healthy-sick, strong-weak, or
      successful-failure?

      • If there is a purpose to his life, how does he know if he has
      accomplished it?


      Insha-Allah starting next week, we will begin to explore these questions
      in light of the Islamic Teachings.
