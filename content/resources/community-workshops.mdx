  - itemTitle: Living a Balanced Life
    itemContent: >
      We are continuously struggling and often failing in meeting lifeâ€™s
      changing demands with respect to ourselves, our families, our jobs, our
      friends, our neighbors, our community and our faith. We often become
      overwhelmed with these changing needs and demands that stress us out and
      at times leave us depressed, confused and helpless. Many becomes overly
      focused on one aspect of life thereby ignoring the other more important
      aspects. For example, becoming solely preoccupied with our work, our
      career golas, having fun, etc., and as a result ignoring the needs of our
      soul, our spouses and children and the obligations to Allah.


      This workshop is designed to:

      1\. To identify some of the Life Pressures and Demands in our Life.

      2\. To understand how people are handling them generally now, and

      3\. And to lean how to best handle all these pressures through Living a
      Balanced Life.
  - itemTitle: Effective Communication
    itemContent: >
      There are literally thousands of books, papers and articles written on the
      importance of effective communication in our relationships. How often
      people complain about having communication problems. There would hardly be
      a person who would deny the need for good communication, but sadly most
      people are lacking the skills required for effective communication.


      This workshop is designed with the following objectives:

      1\. Understanding the process of communication.

      2\. What are the factors that make it effective or ineffective.

      3\. What skills are necessary for effective communication.

      4\. Creating a family environment that promotes open and honest
      communication, and

      5\. How we can promote mutual trust necessary for effective communication.
