      Why are large numbers of Marriages and Families unhealthy these days? Why is there such a high divorce rate in our Muslim communities? Why do have so many issues with our youth today? Why is it that these issues are not getting resolved? The one answer to these question is that we don't have a proper understanding of what marriage is all about. We don't know the rights and responsibilities of a husband and wife towards each other, or we don't care about them. If a husband and wife are not happy and content with other. If they don't have a happy marriage, it is unlikely that they would have a happy and healthy family.
