    itemContent: >
      In the "Human Nature" series of lessons, we learned about the nature of
      Nafs – its various states, the Tempting Nafs, the Self-Reproaching Nafs,
      and the Content Nafs. We also discussed some of the consequences of giving
      into the Tempting Nafs.

      We looked at the verses of the Holy Qur'an wherein Allah (swt) has
      encouraged us to purify this Tempting Nafs.

      Beginning next week, Insha-Allah, we will study the ills of the Tempting
      Nafs and how to cleanse and purify it.

    itemContent: >
      Insha-Allah, starting this week, we are beginning a new series of lessons
      on "Purification of Nafs".

      In the previous series on Human Nature, we learned, among other things,
      that giving into the temptations of nafs causes a person great many
      problems in his personal, family and social life. It also dulls his higher
      cognitive abilities and weakens his motivation.

      Allah (swt), our Creator and our Guide, has taught us the ills of Nafs and
      commanded us to purify it.

      In this series, therefore, we will focus on these ills of Nafs, their
      symptoms, etiology, and treatment.
  - itemTitle: 'Lesson 3: Understanding the Tempting Nafs'
    itemContent: >
      Allah (swt) says in the Holy Qur'an about this Tempting Nafs:

      "قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا ه وَقَدْ خَابَ مَنْ دَسَّاهَا – Truly he
      succeeds that purifies it, And he fails that corrupts it!" (91:9-10)

      The two basic components of Nafs, in Freudian terminology, are ID and
      EGOTISM.

      In its primitive and baser state, Nafs functions very much like Freud's
      ID:


      * Operates on Pleasure Principle – Immediate Gratification, and Tension
      Reduction.

      * Consists of instincts and insatiable and ever growing wants and desires.

      * Does not grow from this state on its own unless disciplined and
      controlled.

      * Never loses its primitive nature even when disciplined, and tends to
      revert to it any time the controls are loosened.
        Egotism:
      * It is narcissistic and self-centered.

      * Expects to be served by all.

      * Likes total freedom.

      * Does not like responsibility

      * Imposes its will on the self and others

      * Does not tolerate opposition

      * Keeps fighting back and seldom gives up

      * Even when retreats, keeps looking for opportunities to strike back and
      gain control.

      * Not easy to reason with.

      * Must be controlled by force and strict discipline.
        Lots of people regardless of their age, education, and beliefs remain stuck on this primitive mode of existence. Many don't see anything wrong with this level of existence.
        This often results in personality, character, emotional, and social-psychological disorders.
        Often the person suffering from these disorders do not seek treatment because they don't believe there is anything wrong with them.
        Besides, these disorders are often not treatable except by teaching the person to learn to discipline and control the Nafs.
        Insha-Allah, we will continue to explore how an undisciplined and uncontrolled nafs gives rise to different disorders.
  - itemTitle: 'Lesson 4: Ramadan and Disciplining the Nafs'
    itemContent: >
      This is a special lesson focusing on the holy month of Ramadan (the month
      of fasting) and how fasting helps in disciplining the Nafs.

      Allah (swt) says in the holy Qur'an:


      "يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ
      عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ ه … شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ
      الَّذِيَ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ
      الْهُدَى وَالْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ –


      O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for
      those before you, that you may (learn) self-restraint… Ramadan is the
      (month) in which was sent down the Qur'an as a guide to mankind and clear
      Signs for guidance and judgment (Between right and wrong). So every one of
      you who witnesses this month should fast in it…" (2:183,185)


      The word تَتَّقُونَ in this verse, which has been translated as
      'self-restrained', is from the root word تَقوٰى.

      تَقوٰى is a very comprehensive word. Among its meanings are: Piety, Fear
      of Allah, Self-restraint, Warding off evil, etc. All these meanings are
      mutually inclusive.


      Allah (swt) asked us to fast in this month so that we become God-fearing,
      self-restrained, pious and able to stay away from all that is evil.

      Clearly, all these characteristics are in contradiction to what the Nafs
      desires – freedom to do anything and everything without any restrictions.


      The Tempting Nafs is at its peak performance when the stomach is full.

      Depriving it from food and drink is the first step in weakening its
      control and curbing its baser nature.


      This is accomplished very easily in the month of Ramadan, when we are
      required to fast for 29 or 30 days.


      Many who are addicted to various things, such as smoking, drinking, etc.,
      go without these things for a whole day, every day during this month.


      This indicates to them that they can control and discipline their Nafs and
      that they can be OK without smokes and drinks.

      Prophet Muhammad (saw) has prescribed fasting for young men who are unable
      to get married due to financial or other restraints and who find it
      difficult to control their sexual desires.


      Once the controls of the Nafs is weakened, the higher cognitive processes
      of heart and soul (wisdom and knowledge) begin to function properly.


      Starving the Nafs also makes one think of those others around the world
      who are starving, which, in turn, fosters caring for others' needs thereby
      decreasing self-centeredness.

      In short, the holy month of Ramadan is an excellent opportunity to begin
      to discipline the Nafs.
