  - itemTitle: Self Awareness
    itemContent: >
      Personal development is at the heart of our journey as counsellors and therapists. It is the core condition of recognizing ourselves and one another as human beings and not human doings. Without it we are detached from the ideology of the meaning of human. What we are depends upon our lived experiences and feedback from others about how we impact on people with whom we come into contact and who we touch, emotionally and spiritually, and who touch us in a similar way. These are the fundamental core elements of our craft as therapists and counsellors. (Derek J. Lainsbury, a Dutch Psychologist)
      Why is it that one teacher has a very difficult time with a student in his/her class, but other teachers don't? Why is it that the same good or bad experience affects all of us so differently? Why is that one person gets easily offended by a student's or a child's using a swear word, and another doesn't?
