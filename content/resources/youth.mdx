  - itemTitle: Building a healthy Self-Identity and Self-Image
    itemContent: >
      An alarming number of our young boys and girls are going through an identity crisis, and, in many cases, the parents also suffer from the same confusion. In such a multi-value and multi-belief environment, it is not easy to figure out who you truly are and who you want to be. Our children struggle to be everything, and often end up with nothing, or something that has limited value in this life, neglecting the everlasting life hereafter. Many of our youth have begun to doubt their faith and have many questions about their beliefs that remain unanswered. They unknowingly and unnoticeably are moving out of Islam, and some are even openly declaring it to their parents.

      This workshop is intended both for the parents and the youth. The objective of these workshops is to guide the parents and the youth how to promote and develop a healthy self-identity and self-image that is based on our true identity – being the servants and the representatives of Allah (swt) on this earth.
