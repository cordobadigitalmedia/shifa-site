There are now scores of "Islamic Schools" in North America. They all have some common factors in terms of their school program, such as, Arabic language classes, Qur'an memorization classes, performing of salah during school hours, etc. Yet, almost all of them suffer from behavioral and discipline problems amongst the students as well as low teacher morale, conflicts between teachers, administration and boards

  - itemTitle: What makes a good Teacher – Bonding with your Students Effectively
    itemContent: >
      There are many young Muslim teachers in the Islamic schools around North America, generously giving their time and energy to educate our children in an 'Islamic environment'. Most of them work for half, and in some cases less than half, of a salary than they can make in a public school system. They all have good intentions, Alhamdulillah; but are good intentions and willingness to sacrifice money, time and energy. sufficient to make a good teacher?

      The objective of this workshop is:

      1. To have the participant share their experiences as a teachein an Islamic school.

      2. To discuss and learn the factors necessary in becoming a good teacher – a teacher who makes an impact in the life of the students and motivates them to excel not only in their goals for this life but the life hereafter as well, and

      3. To learn to bond with the students.

  - itemTitle: Behavior Management in Classroom
    itemContent: >
      Managing the classroom behavior of students has always been problematic for many teachers. How do you deal with a student who is continuously disturbing the class due to his misbehavior? How do you regain your control as a teacher when students continue to talk to each other, misbehave, and not pay any attention to the teacher?

  - itemTitle: Working with Parents
    itemContent: >
      An Islamic school can never fulfill their goal of turning out successful students academically and morally without the participation and assistance of the parents. Schools always complain about the lack of participation of the parents in the school programs and the progress of their children. Some schools are trying some unique ways of getting the parents involved, but the success remains limited in this area.

      This workshop is designed with the following Goals and Objectives:

      1. Understanding how home environment affects the kids' behavior and learning in school

      2. Understanding parent's role in Education and Tarbiyah

      3. Understanding the need to educate the parents as well

      4. Learning effective ways to communicate with the parents

  - itemTitle: Nurturing Spirituality in our Schools
    itemContent: >
      Alhamdulillah, Islamic schools are rapidly emerging around North America and in other western countries. However, what is Islamic about these Islamic schools significantly varies from one school to another with some common features, such as, Arabic classes, memorization of some Surahs of the holy Qur'an, Zuhr prayer in congregation, and provision of Halal food, etc. There may be differences of opinions amongst the board members, teachers, parents and even the students about how Islamic should our Islamic schools be, and what would that mean?

      With the on-going struggles about the Islamization of our schools, when we throw in the concept of nurturing Spirituality, things become even more complex. For example, how does one define spirituality, how does one measure it, how can it be promoted, what is required to promote it, and how may it be achieved?

      This workshop attempts to tackle these questions. The objectives of the workshops are:

      1. To provide an opportunity to the participants to discuss these questions and come to a common understanding of the concept, it's implications and applications, and

      2. To suggest and discuss some specific strategies to nurture Spirituality in our schools.

  - itemTitle: Self Awareness for Teachers
    itemContent: >
      Personal development is at the heart of our journey as counsellors and therapists. It is the core condition of recognizing ourselves and one another as human beings and not human doings. Without it we are detached from the ideology of the meaning of human. What we are depends upon our lived experiences and feedback from others about how we impact on people with whom we come into contact and who we touch, emotionally and spiritually, and who touch us in a similar way. These are the fundamental core elements of our craft as therapists and counsellors. (Derek J. Lainsbury, a Dutch Psychologist)

      Why is it that one teacher has a very difficult time with a student in his/her class, but other teachers don't? Why is it that the same good or bad experience affects all of us so differently? Why is that one person gets easily offended by a student's or a child's using a swear word, and another doesn't?

      These are the puzzles this workshop assists to solve for the participants. It is a two-full-day workshop meant to:

      1. Raise the Self-Awareness of the participants through various exercises, case studies, and self reflections.

      2. Help them deal with their unfinished emotional and psychological issues, and

      3. Provide them some tips and skills on how to recognize when their own emotions and issues subconsciously are affecting their relationships and their ability to function effectively in various aspects of their life.

  - itemTitle: Protecting the Faith and Identity of our Youth
    itemContent: >
      An alarming number of our young boys and girls are going through an identity crisis, and, in many cases, the parents also suffer from the same confusion. In such a multi-value and multi-belief environment, it is not easy to figure out who you truly are and who you want to be. Our children struggle to be everything, and often end up with nothing, or something that has limited value in this life, neglecting the everlasting life hereafter. Many of our youth have begun to doubt their faith and have many questions about their beliefs that remain unanswered. They unknowingly and unnoticeably are moving out of Islam, and some are even openly declaring it to their parents.

      The objective of these workshops is to:

      1. Identify the some of the root causes of this faith and identity crisis in our youth, and

      2. Share some case examples and personal experiences of the participants of these issues, and

      3. Discuss ways of promoting and developing a healthy self-identity and self-image that is based on our true identity – being the servants and the representatives of Allah (swt) on this earth.
