    itemContent: >
      This workshop is designed for the Boards and Teachers of Islamic Schools,
      and the parents whose children are attending Islamic schools. There are
      now scores of “Islamic Schools” in North America. They all have some
      common factors in terms of their school program, such as, Arabic language
      classes, Qur’an memorization classes, performing of salah during school
      hours, etc. Yet, almost all of them suffer from behavioral and discipline
      problems amongst the students as well as low teacher morale, conflicts
      between teachers, administration and boards


      This workshop’s objective is to have the teaching staff, admin staff and
      board members to discuss and understand what makes an Islamic school truly
      Islamic; and how can it be accomplished. The goals are:


      1\. To discuss and clarify the concept, purpose and objectives of
      Education

      2\. To bring a good understanding of why do we need Islamic schools

      3\. To discuss the concept of Tarbiyah and its importance in Islamic
      schools

      4\. What is needed to incorporate Tarbiyah with Education in Islamic
      Schools

      5\. Harmonizing values with the Public School system and the larger
      culture

      6\. Setting up new goals to incorporate effective Tarbiyah with Education

      7\. The Role of Parents in Education and Tarbiyah
