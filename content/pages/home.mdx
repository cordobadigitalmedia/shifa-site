      ## About us


      This service is based in the beautiful northern hemisphere of the earth,
      in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.


      Here you will find life coaching, cyber counseling and therapy, community
      and professional training workshops, on line webinars and small group
      counseling, frequently asked questions and answers, and some web lessons
      on personal growth as well as brief articles on psychological, emotional
      and spiritual issues.


      All services are geared towards facilitating meaningful changes in
      individuals and interpersonal relationships, as well as raising awareness
      of the communities about the rapidly increasing marital, family and youth
      issues and how to best handle them cohesively and meaningfully.


      Browse around, learn and grow, and enjoy your stay here. If you like
      anything, do let us know. If you dislike anything, let us know that too.
      Your constructive feedback is always welcome here as it would help us grow
      along with you.
