      These workshops are provided to the communities upon request by the local
      community agencies, such as, Masaajid, Islamic organizations, or other
      local groups. A request may be made via the website, www\.shifa.ca, by
      filling out a Request for Workshop form.


      The cost includes airfare, boarding and lodging, and workshop fees.


      All workshops are participatory and interactive. Questions and Answers are
      through and through. The common intent of all the workshop is not just to
      provide information, but to make the participant learn more about
      themselves, share their experiences, and inspire them to change for the
      better and learn to handle the life issues in more a healthy way.


      All workshops are at least half a day long (3.5 hours). Some are a full
      day (7 hours). They may be shortened to a 1.5 â€“ 2 hour seminars, but the
      audience participation will be minimal.


      Workshop may also be tailor made to meet the specific needs of the
      communities or training.
