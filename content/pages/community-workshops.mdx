      These workshops are provided to the communities upon request by the local
      community agencies, such as, Masaajid, Islamic organizations, or other
      local groups. A request may be made via the website, www\.shifa.ca, by
      filling out a Request for Workshop form.


      The cost includes airfare, boarding and lodging, and workshop fees.


      All workshops are participatory and interactive. Questions and Answers are
      through and through. The common intent of all the workshop is not just to
      provide information, but to make the participant learn more about
      themselves, share their experiences, and inspire them to change for the
      better and learn to handle the life issues in more a healthy way.


      All workshops are at least half a day long (3.5 hours). Some are a full
      day (7 hours). They may be shortened to a 1.5 – 2 hour seminars, but the
      audience participation will be minimal.


      Workshop may also be tailor made to meet the specific needs of the
      communities or training.

          We are continuously struggling and often failing in meeting life’s
          changing demands with respect to ourselves, our families, our jobs,
          our friends, our neighbors, our community and our faith. We often
          become overwhelmed with these changing needs and demands that stress
          us out and at times leave us depressed, confused and helpless. Many
          becomes overly focused on one aspect of life thereby ignoring the
          other more important aspects. For example, becoming solely preoccupied
          with our work, our career golas, having fun, etc., and as a result
          ignoring the needs of our soul, our spouses and children and the
          obligations to Allah.


          This workshop is designed to:

          1\. To identify some of the Life Pressures and Demands in our Life.

          2\. To understand how people are handling them generally now, and

          3\. And to lean how to best handle all these pressures through Living
          a Balanced Life.
