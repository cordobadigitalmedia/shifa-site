      ## Professional Training for Teachers and School Boards


      It is recommended that the following workshops are organized both for the
      teachers and the parents, so that the two parties who should play the
      pivotal role in the education and development of the children can remain
      on the same page about the issues dealt with in these workshops. In some
      workshops it will be important to include school administration and the
      board members.

          There are many young Muslim teachers in the Islamic schools around
          North America, generously giving their time and energy to educate our
          children in an ‘Islamic environment’. Most of them work for half, and
          in some cases less than half, of a salary than they can make in a
          public school system. They all have good intentions, Alhamdulillah;
          but are good intentions and willingness to sacrifice money, time and
          energy. sufficient to make a good teacher?


          The objective of this workshop is:

          1\. To have the participant share their experiences as a teachein an
          Islamic school.

          2\. To discuss and learn the factors necessary in becoming a good
          teacher – a teacher who makes an impact in the life of the students
          and motivates them to excel not only in their goals for this life but

          3\. To learn to bond with the students.
