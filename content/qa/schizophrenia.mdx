  - question: >-
      As a social worker, I have a client who is a Muslim and he is diagnosed as
      having schizophrenia. in addition to the treatment by a psychiatrist he is
      going to his home-country, Morocco to be treated by a Muslim healer. This
      healer treats him with verses of the Koran. could you enlighten me about
      the nature of this treatment? The effect is not very clear to me but
      neither is the treatment of the psychiatrist. What does Islam say about
      the cause of schizophrenia? I would be very happy if you can answer my
      question so that I will be able to help my client. Do you where I can find
      more information about the Islamic view on psychiatric illness? cause,
      treatment. thank you very much.
    answer: >
      Your question is very important and merits a very detailed response. The
      Islamic perspective on mental illness cannot be satisfactorily explained
      in a short answer; and this forum is not meant for long explanatory
      responses. However, I will attempt to clarify a couple of points you have
      raised.


      * How does healing through Qur'anic verses work, or does it even work?


      Muslims understand the holy Qur'an to be the word of Allah s.w\.t. It is
      meant to provide: guidance for daily life, clear indications of what is
      right and wrong – what is desirable and undesirable, what is safe and what
      is risky, what is dangerous and clearly harmful, and what is good and
      evil. It's words, phrases, and verses are also believed to have the power
      to cleanse and heal from the filth and diseases of body and soul with the
      Will of Allah the Almighty. The last phrase of this last sentence is very
      important to remember. What it essentially points out is that the holy
      Qur'an is not a book of spells and charms, or a prescription book for
      various diseases that may be tested in a laboratory or in the field
      through scientific research, simply because the effects of the independent
      variable (the verses of Qur'an) are determined by many other independent
      variables that may not be controlled, such as, the spiritual enlightenment
      of the healer, the beliefs of the person being healed, the environmental
      conditions, and ultimately the Will of Allah. This is not much different
      or unique than measuring the effects of a psychiatric, psychological or
      medical treatment, which are also dependent on similar independent
      variables – the knowledge and experience of the professional, the
      psychological and bio-chemical make-up of the patient, the patients
      willingness to follow the treatment regimen, various other environmental
      conditions. So, does this healing work? We, the Muslims, believe it does,
      but the effects and length of time it takes varies based on some of the
      independent variables I mentioned above.


      Islam does not specifically address the issue of schizophrenia or, for
      that matter, any other mental or physical disease. Islam is a faith, and
      like other faiths, it is meant to provide guidance and principles for a
      healthy, meaningful, and successful life. In this vein, the holy Qur'an
      and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) provide hints
      to factors that may cause a person to act like a mad man, and it also
      provides guidance about prevention and healing from such madness. As I
      mentioned in my introductory sentence above, it will take a lot of
      explaining to clarify all the concepts, beliefs, causes and effects of
      these factors.


      To help us understand further Wa'el Hindi comments:


      What is important to emphasize is that using the Qur'anic verses in
      treating psychiatric patients is a form of religious psychotherapy which
      can help believers only , and in fact not all believers but those who can
      understand the meaning of the verses.


      Then in which form of psychotherapy could the meaning of Qu'ranic verses
      be put, the answer is surely in the cognitive form, for this reason we
      can't use it with an actively psychotic patient (one who is deluded or
      hallucinating), then for using the holly Qur'anic in treating a chronic
      schizophrenic Moslem could only be helpful when cognitive psychotherapy
      could be applied, to help him restructure his cognitions in a way that is
      compatible with his religious culture.


      The use of Qur'anic verses in treating a schizophrenic Muslem patient thus
      needs:


      * The healer who knows what is schizophrenia

      * the patient who is a suitable candidate for cognitive psychotherapy.


      When we search for the healer in the Arab world we only talk of
      psychiatrists or advanced psychologists or social workers who carry at
      least a master degree , however most of such healers neither practiced nor
      talked about treating schizophrenics using Qur'anic verses, simply because
      most of them have western way of thinking !


      Then the person who was treating your patient in Morocco was a traditional
      healer. Whereas Western science looks into the etiology of schizophrenia,
      Islam says Allah Knows for is a multi-factorial disorder that has its
      origin in the total psycho bio-social constitution of the patient, which
      needs management with scientifically qualified persons, the psychiatrists
      and their co-workers, the Islamic view is originally the same like that of
      behavioral sciences.
