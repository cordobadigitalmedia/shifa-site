      Dear Dr. Sadiq, I am married and have 5 kids. All over the past years I have been going through a lot of depression due to the daily pressures and poor family circumstances. I have tried lots to forget my problems, but I am always met with failure. I want to start a new life this Ramadan, but I need some suggestions from you.
    answer: >
      Sister Madiha,

      Assalamu`alykum. I am sorry to hear that you have been suffering from depression for the past years. Generally, there are always reasons that make a person depressed and those reasons must be looked at and resolved. However, since we are talking about the holy month of Ramadan as an opportunity to begin to solve our emotional and psychological problems, here is what I would suggest:

      The holy month is an opportunity to strengthen our iman and our soul. Lots of emotional problems result from a weak will, a strong nafs and a weak soul. Fasting and the baraka of the holy month are excellent opportunities to weaken the nafs, thereby strengthening the soul and the will. Alhamdullilah, it sounds like you have made a decision to start a new life this Ramadan. Through fasting and receiving the barakas of the months, look at the possible reasons that may be causing your depression. You should be able to do this more calmly during the fasting month with a lot of patience. It is important that the factors causing depression are problem dealt with; and you should be able to do this with a stronger will and weaker nafs. I hope this helps. May Allah SWT bless you with the nur and the barakas of the months and help you resolve your family problems.

      If I could be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to write back, or e-mail me at drsadiq@shaw.ca

      I have a Question, but I really feel sorrow writing it online, but I didn't want to miss your suggestions as a certified counselor who can help me through the way. I committed zina a month ago, and I am absolutely depressed and don't know what to do in Ramadan. I don't feel like fasting. I feel like killing myself. Please help …help….help.
    answer: >
      Dear brother in Islam,

      I am happy to hear about your remorse and depression over the transgression you committed. Feeling remorse after disobeying Allah SWT is a strong sign of iman. I want you to remember that to err is human, and even the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) had made such errors. I also want you to remember that Allah's SWT mercy has no bounds. With your remorse and sincere repentance, Allah SWT has promised to forgive all sins – minor or major. I therefore suggest that you pray two rak'ahs with the intention of making tawbah, remorsefully and sincerely beg Allah SWT for His forgiveness, and be thankful that Allah SWT has granted you this holy month to continue to strengthen your iman and your soul and to be strong enough in the future not to disobey Him. Do not allow Shaitan to make you depressed and worried so much that you lose the blessings and the forgiveness of Allah that are rampant in this month.

      May Allah SWT give you strength and courage to be His obedience servant in your future life.

      In Ramadan in iftar or suhur times when we switch on to televsion to see the Adhan or ending time of sehri or iftar . I am talking of places where mosques are far the Adhan is hard to hear. While watching the Adhan on television they show advertisments with music and women .Does this thing affect our roza (fast)?
    answer: >
      Dear brother Fawad,

      Here is a simple solution to your problem. The best thing to do is not to turn on the TV, obtain a calendar for suhur and future time for the month, and make adhan in your home yourself. This would save you from looking at the advertisements on the TV as well as, with the sound of adhan, will drive shaitan away from your home.

  - question: How can family resolve problems in Ramadan? I don't think if there is a real problem it could be solved in any time. Can you clarify how people can resolve their problems?
    answer: >
      Brother Mo'min, indeed problems can be resolved anytime during the year. The benefits of this holy month are:

      1. Due to fasting, nafs and the ego are weaker.

      2. There is less interference from Shaitan.

      3. Iman is generally stronger.

      4. Hearts become softer.

      As result, people are more willing to be kind and considerate to each other, more willing to forgive each other, and more willing to make peace. On top, with the sincere attempt made to resolve the problems, Allah SWT's help and mercy are more readily available during this month. I hope this explains to you how this blessed month is an opportune time to resolve these types of problems.

  - question: >-
      Dr. Sadiq, as-Salamu'alaykum! I have suffered from depression for most of my life (since I was three years old) and it has gotten to the point that it is just how I expect to be, even though I've begun hurting myself. My depression has negatively affected not only my life, but has hurt those around me. I am on medicine to treat my condition, but it does not seem to help. What advice or help can you give me? Thanks.
    answer: >
      Daniel, wa `alaykum as-Salamu warahmatullah.

      It sounds like depression has been a life long problem for you. I am sure that you have been receiving help for it all along. Has a proper assessment been made for your depression? I need to know a whole bunch of things from you about your life so far and your current circumstances before I can give you sound advice.

      However, this blessed month may be a good time to turn things around. You know that things that appear to be beyond our control, are not beyond the control of Allah SWT. He can change in a blink what we have not been able to change in years. So, make good use of this blessed month. Spend you time in prayer, recitation of the holy Qur'an and supplications, and have faith in Allah's powers to change things for you.

      If you like to give me further details of your illness, write to me at drsadiq@shaw.ca

      I pray for your well being. May Allah grant you strength, courage and patience.

      As-Salamu `Alaykum, I am 36 years old and have been trying to get married for a long time. So far no luck. This has resulted in feelings of depression, low self esteem and lots of other psychological issues. I have met someone really nice online – he's quite decent and we're trying to get to know each other better. My problem is that I feel scared that it won't work, he'll choose someone else who lives closer to him, he'll leave me. I know all of these problems aren't logical but I can't help feeling this way. I would like to know if there are any du`as I can recite this Ramadan or do anything to strengthen my faith and sort these psychosomatic issues out.

      Thank you for your help and anyone reading this, pray for me!!!

      Sister Hadiqa, wa `alaykum as-Salamu warahmatullah.

      There are things that we control and then there are those things that are totally beyond our control. Is finding someone to get married totally in your control? Obviously not. It is for all such things that are beyond our control that we turn to Allah SWT for help. Shaitan leads us to give up hope so that we would not turn to Allah SWT. Don't allow yourself to be led by the devil. Have faith in Allah SWT, and know that there is always a time for everything. Nothing happens before it is destined. Have patience, and turn to Allah SWT in this blessed month for help, forgiveness and patience. Focus your attention more and make an effort in the areas which you have control over, and leave the rest upon Allah SWT. The less you are worried and pre-occupied with your marriage, the better you would feel about yourself. I pray for your well being.

      As-Salamu`alaykum, I have a problem which might sound silly to some people. I have always dreamed of joining the mujahideen and hopefully dying as a martyr, but I cannot obtain my parents permission so I cannot do so. The point is that my parents want me to get married, and I think I should as well, but I am reluctant to do so as I feel that after marriage, due to the responsibilities with looking after and loving a wife, my zeal for Jihad and helping my opressed brothers & sisters might diminish. I would be most grateful if you could give me some advice on this matter.
    answer: >
      Brother Mido, wa `alaykum as-Salamu warahmatullah.

      I admire your desire to join the mujahideen to help the oppressed brothers and sisters around the world, and die as a martyr. I also admire your sense of respect and loyalty to your parents' desires and wishes for you.

      I am sure you know that there are several types of Jihad. One is what you wish to engage in. Another is to serve your parents while they need you. Another is to battle against the undue desires and impulses of your nafs.

      Once a young man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and asked for his permission to join the mujahideen. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asked him, "are your parents alive?" He said yes. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) admonished him to go and serve his parents.

      On another occasion, while returning home from a battlefield, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) has been reported as saying, "we are returning to a greater jihad from a smaller one," meaning that the battle with one's own nafs is a constant and on going battle.

      Once A'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), "Can someone acquire the status of a martyr without being killed in a battlefield?" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) responded, "Yes, one who remembers his death twenty (or twenty five) times a day may acquire the status of a martyr."

      So, my dear brother, don't despair. If Allah wills for you to join the mujahideen one day, He would make ways for you to do it. Meanwhile, you have lots of other jihads at hand; so get busy with your battles.

      As-Salamu`alykum, Iam married for 28 years, alhamdulillah after a lot of ups and downs,we found our way to Islam. Now it was a big change for the children(4) getting involved a lot with Islam I understand many things a lot different than before. My problem are my children they are not as convinced as I am and think that I am afraid of their father and blame their father for everything. Whenever I try to make them understand they say that I am defending him. I find myself in a position to having to explain myself to them all the time, as if they would educate me and not me them.What should I do?
    answer: >
      Sister Umasharf, wa `alaykum as-Salamu warahmatullah.

      The best way to educate and train the children in any faith is to become a living model of it in your daily life. Learn and practice Islam in your daily life as best as you can. This holy month provides ample opportunity to be a good role model for your children. Another important thing is for you and your husband to have a common understanding of the principles of Islam, and for both of you to practice it together. Again, the month of Ramadan is a good opportunity to do so. Lastly, do not get into arguments with your children about the faith. Encourage Questions, and provide simple to understand Answer s. If they do not accept, let it go. Keep practicing the faith yourselves, and you would notice that your sincerity with Allah SWT will insha'Allah spread into the hearts of your children sooner or later.

      May Allah give you strength and courage!

      As-Salamu`alaykum Dr. Muhammad,I wanted to ask you how can I get rid of waswasa. I pray and read Adhkar every day but it sticks to me whenever I pray to ask Allah for something I need! It starts to whisper to me that I don't deserve from Allah to help me or fulfill my hopes and it makes me always feel guilty ,and sometimes it makes me feel as if I prayed a bad du`a' for example (for some people whom I love very much to die)! I can't concentrate each time I pray or ask Allah His forgiveness or any thing else. Thank you so much,jazakum Allah khairab.
    answer: >
      Sister Sally, wa `alaykum as-Salamu warahmatullah.
      I will tell you the best way to get rid of the waswasa – IGNORE THEM.

      None of us are free of waswasa. One of the characteristics of waswasa from Shaitan is that the more you pay attention to it, the more bothersome and strong it becomes. The more you ignore it, the less it bothers you.

      You do believe that Allah SWT will not hold you accountable for your waswasa. You also do believe that He is most merciful and kind. So then, whenever you are praying, reciting the holy Qur'an or making supplications, ignore the waswasa. When they come, just bring your attention back to your ibadah. Keep doing it and have faith that Allah SWT is rewarding you for your Jihad with Shaitan.

  - question: Please, I need your help. I have a problem with my parents because I married a committed Muslim girl who is not my relative, while my parents wanted me to marry my relative. Every Ramadan, I invite them over on Iftar but they always refuse. My wife buys them gifts on Eid and they return them back. I really don't enjoy Ramadan when I have this kind of treatment from my parents. Can you give me some tips on how to solve this problem?
    answer: >
      Dear Luqman,

      Don't make your parents' problems yours. Continue to be respectful and kind with them despite the fact that they are not accepting it. In this blessed month, send them a note asking for their forgiveness for the sake of Allah and this blessed month. Forgive them yourself, and pray to Allah to clear their hearts from anger and disappointments towards you.

      I pray for you and your parents.

      My Question is that someone I know suffers from a phobia of thunder and lightning and gets really scared even when it gets slightly cloudy. I was wondering if there are any du`a or procedures she can do to cure herself. There aren't any counselors or reputable psychologists where we live. Thank you for your help and may you have a prosperous Ramadan.

    answer: >
      Abu Anas, wa `alaykum as-Salamu warahmatullah.

      One of the ways is to attend the taraweeh prayers every night where the holy Qur'an is recited from beginning to the end during the month. That way, at least you can hear it all from the beginning to the end.

      Secondly, if you recite one Juz' everyday of the holy month, you will Insha'Allah finish it by the end of the month. This is what I do. Start on the first evening of the holy month, Insha'Allah.

  - question: >-
      Wow, just yesterday I mentioned that I was going to use Ramadan to help me with my anxiety and depression! I have been suffering from anxiety, panic attacks, and have developed some phobias since stopping my medication (that I was prescribed for "major depression") several years ago. The medication did not help, and I saw tons of physicians and experts and they emphasized medication more than psycho-therapy, and my anxiety was never addressed in any therapy. Now, I still have it, and its getting worse. I know that the Quran is a healing for whatever ails the heart, and I understand Qadr, and all of the Islamic philisophical ideas– I just have a problem connecting my "logical" brain to my "illogical" brain. I have found that cutting out caffiene and exercising daily helps. I'm also trying to incrase my vitaminE intake, and improve my diet all around. However, I still have problems dealing with irrational fears. How can I use Ramadan to help with that?
    answer: >
      Dear sister,

      Ramadan is a month that is especially helpful in strengthening our Iman. All fears and irrational thoughts are put in your mind by shaitan, and shayateen are locked up during this blessed month. Thus, an opportune time for you to overcome these irrational fears by strengthening your Iman and faith in Allah SWT the key being the knowledge that nothing may harm or benefit you without the will of Allah SWT. Just that bit of Iman, if you acquired it, would be sufficient in helping you get rid of your fears.

      About phobias. They are treatable. If you still have them, write to me at drsadiq@shaw.ca later and I would Insha Allah assit you in tackling them.

      Obviously, you do not have proper knowledge of Islam. Islam does not teach hate, murder, and oppression. People learn it from each other and do these things out of desperation.

      Does your religion (whatever it is that you believe in) teach hate, murder, and oppression? If not, why are people of your religion engaged into such activity around the world?

  - question: As-Salamu `Alaykum, don't you think that the day in which we live is reason enough for depression? Shouldn't we be depressed as an acurate indicator to our environment? What do you think? As-Salamu`alaykum.
    answer: >
      Sister,

      People may always find reasons to be depressed. I think it is a matter of human perception and belief.

      If I believe that things are beyond help, out of control, and therefore life is not worth living, I would get depressed. On the other hand, if I believe that there is a God who has everything under His control, that there is always hope, that I am required only to do my best to keep my life in order and leave the rest to Allah SWT, I will not be that depressed.

      Hope this helps.
