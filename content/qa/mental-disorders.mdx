      Dear Sheikh, for over a couple of years now I deal with a severe
      depression. I feel worthless, stupid and useless. I also feel very lonely.
      Sometimes I think that being dead is better. How can I as a Muslimah learn
      to love and appreciate myself? I cry a lot and feel very unhappy. How can
      I get rid of my unstable behavior? Please help me. At the moment I have a
      counselor but a non-Muslim. I want to know how I can heal myself with the
      medicine of Allah. Jazaak Allah.
    answer: >
      Sister Kareemah: Assalamu \`alaykum,

      There are several types of depressions. One is genetic in nature, so if
      there is a history of depression in your extended family, it makes the
      offspring more prone to depression. Another type of depression is reactive
      in nature; they result from on-going unpleasant events in life. Depending
      upon the origin, length and severity of depression, a treatment regimen is
      determined which may consist of medications as well as counseling and
      therapy.

      Regardless of the origin of depression, if a person learns to change
      his/her ways of thinking and lives by healthy Islamic beliefs, it would
      bring internal strength to deal and cope with the disappointments of life.
      So, look at where is your depression coming from, and what are the
      messages you give yourself in your head that makes you feel depressed,
      continue to take properly prescribed medicine and seek counselling/therapy
      to help you examine your beliefs and change your ways of thinking and
      responding to events in life. Insha'Allah, it would begin to make you
      stronger to deal with your depression.

      Assalamu`alaykum Wa Rahmat Allah Wa Barakatuhu

      OCD tends to be one of the difficult mental disorders to treat especially
      if obsessions are religious & sexual. The obsessions, the anxiety and the
      most difficult part the "feelings" which are indescribable and unbearable.
      It stays with the patient for days and sometimes even months are much
      difficult for the patient to cope with. It is a daily battle.

      When an OCD patient cannot be at easy at whatever he does to help himself
      to face this demon. What shall he do? If the patient helps himself by the
      statements like "Allah will surely help me" "just be patient" etc., etc.,
      All these statements backfire with more obsessions sticking on the
      statements. How a person will be at ease under these circumstances.

      For other type of illness a patient can support himself by telling himself
      to be patient. But OCD does not allow that, you cannot be at peace with
      OCD. I know Allah does not give a soul more than it can bear. But if you
      ask an OCD patient what's going on, he cannot describe. If medicines do
      not much help and if consistent prayers do not change the situation. What
      should one do?? Your comments please to handle or manage OCD. Thanks and
      best regards.
    answer: >
      Dear Brother, Wa alaikum salaamu warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.

      I truly feel for your situation. OCD truly is a debilitating mental
      illness. I have been dealing with a couple of these cases presently. As
      you said, it is often related to religious and sexual issues. Often, there
      is also sexual abuse or indulging into sexual pleasures in the history.
      There is also high degree of guilt associated with this history. The
      person is often trying to wash away his guilt or desperately trying to
      ward off evil. The condition often has severe effects on a person's daily
      life.

      However, by the Grace of Allah (SWT), it is treatable, although it takes a
      long time to treat it. But, if the patient sincerely follows the
      prescribed treatment regimen, which may consist of medication as well as
      psychotherapy, it helps bring the obsessions and compulsions under
      control.

      I am not sure if you have received any psychotherapy for your condition.
      If not, please consult with an experienced counselor/psychologist locally.
      If one is not available, contact me at
      [https://www.shifa.ca/](https://www.shifa.ca/). I will try to help you
      long distance through cyber counselling.

      Hope this helps, Insha'Allah.

      Assalamualaikum. Thank you for your time reading my problem… I'm a single
      woman who is 28 years old, not married and don't have any boyfriend… about
      3 years ago I was diagnosed by having mental problem… I'm suffering from
      schizophrenia… right now I'm working as a library assistant. From time to
      time I always think why I get schizophrenia. Now I know why I was
      diagnosed as one of schizophrenia patients. Right now I am working hard as
      I could to help myself to regain my life back. I'm a graduate in
      accounting but I'm not working as accountant due to my problem health. My
      problem is: can schizophrenia patient like to be married to someone and be
      a good mother. I don't want to be alone with all my life. Please help me…
    answer: >
      Dear Sister, Wa alaikum salaamu warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,

      It is sad to hear your situation. However, there is always hope for a true
      believer. Schizophrenia is of different types. Without knowing which type
      of schizophrenia you are suffering from, I cannot tell you the prognosis.
      As well, the prognosis is not very good if the onset of the illness was
      early in life like in late teen age. If the onset is later in life, the
      prognosis to get rid off the illness is much better. In your case, it
      seems that you were doing well up until age 25. So, insha'Allah there is
      better hope.

      Now, regardless of the severity of the illness, Schizophrenia is
      manageable, and many patients I know who were diagnosed as schizophrenic,
      are living an acceptably normal life, married and with children too. Many
      are very highly educated people as well.

      So, with proper medication management, psychotherapy and good family
      support, you should do well Insha'Allah.

      If you had told me some of the symptoms of your illness, it would have
      helped me understand the nature and severity of your illness to suggest
      more specific things for you to consider.

      Anyways, if you need more assistance in this regard, please don't hesitate
      to contact me at [https://www.shifa.ca/](https://www.shifa.ca/), and go to
      the counselling page.

      I pray for your well being Insha'Allah.

  - question: 'As-salamu`alaykum, please what can I do to have self-confidence?'
    answer: >
      Dear Brother Ishaq: Wa'alaykum assalaam,

      A lack of self-confidence may result from many things, among which are: a
      family background where family members continually put a child down, scold
      him, make him feel worthless, inadequate, deprive him of love and care,
      etc.; consistent failures in daily life struggles, etc.

      Here is what I generally prescribe as homework to people who have problem
      with low self confidence:


      1. Write an autobiography detailing your childhood, your family life, your
      life experiences so far, and everything else that you think important in
      your life so far. It would help you understand how you got where you are
      at right now emotionally.

      2. List on a separate paper all your weaknesses and at least 3 to 5
      strengths. Allah (swt) has blessed us all with strengths and weaknesses.
      So, look hard for your strengths while you identify your weaknesses more
      readily.

      3. Be grateful and pay thanks to Allah (swt) for the strengths.

      4. Make a step-by-step goal plan of using your strengths in achieving your
      goals. Make sure that your goals are achievable. Break them down in small
      steps, and then take one step at a time without ever worrying about the
      end result. The end result – success or failure, is in the hands of Allah
      (swt).

      5. Don't accept from yourself any less than you can truly do, and accept
      at the end whatever the results are.

      6. If you fail, pray to Allah (swt) for help and try again. Remember, the
      sincere efforts of a person never always go in vain.
         Hope this helps. Contact me if you need further assistance at [https://www.shifa.ca/](https://www.shifa.ca/).

      Would you please try to give me some steps I might try to deal with
      depression? I live in a small town far from any Muslim help (mosque,
      community centre, etc.) and do not have access to a Muslim counselor of
      any kind. I have suffered from depression off and on since as far as I can
      remember (I am 51). Trying to be busy doesn't help, neither does prayer or
      dhikr. When it hits me (depression) I am helpless to do anything about it.
      It makes many of my days like a hell. I would appreciate any help you
      could offer. Thank you and God bless you for your help and your time.
    answer: >
      Dear Sister Aziza: Assalamu 'Alaykum, Please read my earlier Answer to
      another sister on depression.

      It seems that you have been suffering from depression for a very long
      time. It is also clear that there are times when you are not depressed, as
      you have said, "when it hits me". What makes it hit you and how often does
      it hit you? Considering that you have suffered from it for a long time and
      have survived well enough so far, you must have found some ways to cope
      and deal with it. You must have some internal strengths that help you deal
      with it. What are these strengths? Read my last response to a brother
      regarding Low Self Confidence. I have suggested to him some homework. You
      may want to try some of that yourself.

      Now, if there is history of depression in your family, you are likely to
      be hit by it from time to time, but remember that you have survived it so
      far and can continue to cope with it, gradually in a more healthy way.

      Getting some help with examining your beliefs and your mental attitude
      towards this depression may help as well. If you don't have any
      counselors/therapists available locally, do contact me through my website
      at [https://www.shifa.ca/](https://www.shifa.ca/) if you need further help
      with this.

      As-salamu`alaykum dear professor, I can't help noticing how psychological
      diseases have increased immensely in our time. I was wondering if there is
      a relationship between what is happening in the world and the increase of
      mental disease. Thanks for your time.
    answer: >
      Sister Amal: Wa alaikum salaamu warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,

      Indeed mental illnesses and psychological problems have increased
      tremendously these days. Whereas, before they used to be illnesses of
      western societies largely, now all people in the world are suffering from
      more of these illnesses.

      There are many reasons for this. One, in my view, is the fact that when a
      person becomes too materialistically oriented with all his preoccupations
      with him/herself and his/her short life in this world, one becomes more
      prone to emotional disturbances, because the larger perspective of life is
      lost. It is the light at the end of the tunnel that makes one keep
      crawling further and further in the dark tunnels of life. It is the hope
      that one day I will be out of this tunnel Insha'Allah and that there is a
      better life for me out there sooner or later. It is the belief that life
      is never total fun and happiness and that I have to have my share of
      disappointments, failures, etc., that keeps one strong and relatively free
      of these emotional disturbances. But, unfortunately we have lost this
      perspective, and consequently suffer from lots of emotional problems.

      My brother is 17 years old with severe mental illness since he was 6 years
      old. He's now in the hospital with assistance from al workers but my
      mother wants him to live with us at home even it'll be very difficult to
      deal with him and take care of him. She thinks that leaving her son in the
      hospital means increasing dependence on als and doesn't allow him to
      communicate with others. And she is afraid if he left the hospital one day
      he'll face a lot of troubles according to this dependence. What do you
      suggest, doctor?
    answer: >
      Brother Abdullah, Assalamu 'Alaikum,

      I am sorry to hear about your brother. I think the Answer will depend
      completely upon the nature and severity of his illness. If his illness can
      be brought under control and managed through medication and a supportive
      and understanding family environment, then yes he can be brought home with
      regular assessment visits with the doctors. But, if his illness is
      unpredictable and cannot be managed through medication and other
      treatments, then it will be a burden on the family to manage him without
      proper knowledge of what is happening with him and how to handle it on a
      daily basis.

      I am sorry, I cannot help you any more without knowing exactly the nature,
      history, symptoms of his illness and effectiveness of treatment so far.

      Salamu'Alaikum Professor: What are the causes of mental illnesses in
      general? Are they hereditary or acquired in life? Jazaka'Allau khairan.
    answer: >
      Wa alaikum salaamu warahmatullahi wabarakatuh:

      The Answer to your Question depends upon which school of thought one comes
      from in the field of mental health.

      Some, especially in the field of medicine/psychiatry, believe it to be
      largely hereditary and biological in nature. Other, especially in the
      fields of psychology/social work/faith, etc., attribute it to
      socio/cultural/familial factors, thereby disregarding the possibility of
      heredity and biochemical changes in the brain.

      For me, the causes of mental illness may be either or both. In my
      practice, I don't begin with one or other assumption, each person is
      unique and a true diagnosis can be only made by looking at his/her unique
      life and family, without putting him in preformed boxes of theories.

      I have a problem with my mother-in-law. She has an Obsessive Compulsive
      Disorder. She is obsessed with cleanliness, hygiene etc. although she does
      not realise she has a problem. She is constantly worried about germs &
      bacteria. I will give you some examples;

      1. She will not touch an outside door handle, only with gloves or a
      tissue.

      2. She insists that her cutlery, plates the table etc is washed properly
      whenever we go out to eat.

      3. If you sit on public transport you have to get changed before sitting
      on her furniture.

      I'm not going to even start on how she prepares food.

      Anyway, when i first moved into her house, it didn't really bother me, but
      now I have a baby & as you can imagine you have to be extra clean around
      the baby. I'm not able to bath her when I want, just in case she catches a
      cold, I cant feed her certain foods, I cant take her out as often as I
      would like, just incase she catches an infection. The list goes on. I am
      actually worried that this will affect my daughters growth, development,
      behavior etc. It is really frustrating me now & although I know this is a
      mental disorder, I am finding it very difficult to deal with.

      She doesn't accept that she has a problem, instead thinks we are all dirty
      and careless. How can I make her realize that we are all 'normal' & she is
      the one with the problem & she is making all our lives difficult.
    answer: >
      Dear Sister, Assalamu Alaikum,

      Please read my earlier Answer to another brother with OCD. OCD is often
      associated with and obsession with cleanliness and exaggerated worries
      about catching filth, germs, etc.

      This disease is not easy to treat. Like in many mental illnesses, the
      older a person gets with this disease, the more difficult is to treat
      him/her, often because the person adapts to the disease and does not
      consider it as an illness.

      Your worries are valid. If a growing child is subjected to these types of
      obsessive compulsive behavior towards cleanliness, he/she may acquire the
      same symptoms later in life.

      I don't know of your family circumstances, so making appropriate
      recommendations will be difficult for me. Before, I can make further
      recommendation, I need to know who all live in the same household, how are
      they affected by it and cope with it, how does your husband think and feel
      about your concerns, what are the possibilities of living separately, how
      old is your baby, etc.

      But, you may wish to consult with a qualified al in your locality, and I
      am sure he/she may be able to make further recommendations to you in this
      regard. Or, contact me through my website at
      [www.shifa.ca](http://www.shifa.ca)

      One more thing, continue to be kind and caring with your mother-in-law,
      knowing that she has a mental illness and is not doing these things to
      make your life miserable. We pity, have mercy and deal with kindness with
      those who suffer from illnesses and problems rather than getting angry
      with them.

      I always think life is more of a struggle and I feel bad about my self and
      life in most ways. At times, I feel complete despair. All my friends say
      that I'm probably depressed and I have to visit a psychiatrist, but only
      one of my friends told me that I have only to be more religious. What do
      you think?
    answer: >
      Dear sister Somana: Assalamu Alaikum,

      Life indeed is a struggle for all of us in many ways. But, it has its good
      moments. If one is not able to appreciate the good moments of life and is
      always brooding about its struggles and challenges, then one does need
      help. But, this also does not necessarily mean that one is suffering from
      depression.

      What needs to happen is one has to learn different and healthy ways of
      thinking and responding to these struggles of life; and that is what I
      believe you need. Becoming more religious may mean different things to
      different people. But, if you begin to understand the teachings of
      religion about life and its struggles, then it would help you change the
      way you think about them and therefore you would respond to them
      differently, more healthily.

      Hope this helps.

      I have a son who is acting really strange lately. We are a Muslim family
      and have been so for his whole life. We do all the expectations our
      religion calls for. Lately my son has started wearing an upside star on
      his neck and wishes to be called Satan. He wears black nail polish and has
      colored his hair black. He has put a huge lock on his door and plays loud
      music. The music has hateful lyrics and sounds awful. Last week we caught
      him in the house with three naked girls. We excused the girls and talked
      to him about the matter. He insisted the girls were itchy and he was
      merely trying to remedy the situation. We didn't buy that excuse and
      grounded him. Because we have grounded him, he says he will put something
      in our food to poison us. Last night I caught him in the kitchen opening
      different bottles. I asked him what he was doing and he merely grinned and
      said he was looking for a drink. My wife and I are scared now. I asked him
      about it and he said he summoned all the demons in the universe to live
      within him. It's crazy!
    answer: >
      Dear Marty, Assalamu Alaikum,

      Wow, it is crazy. You have not told me how old is your son and how lately
      these behaviors have begun. But, from the sound of it, it is highly likely
      that he has ended up in some type of cult, or a company that thrives on
      these gothic, cultic type of thinking and practices. Depending upon
      whether he is into drugs as well or not, he may be quite dangerous to
      himself and to others.

      You must seek urgent help from him from the local youth facilities and
      als. A proper diagnosis has to be made in order to understand the nature
      and origin of these behaviors, so we can come up with a treatment plan for
      him and for the family.

      Sorry, without further knowledge, I am not able to make specific
      recommendations, except to be very careful about him and around him. I
      assume he is in his early teans, like 12-14 years.

      Anyways, it is an interesting case. I have worked in a residential
      institution for severaly emotionally and behaviorally disturbed youth, and
      have seen many such cases in my 13 years of work there. With a change of
      environment and strict controls around them to ensure no drug/alcohol
      intake, and a structured life routines bring these symptoms under control
      quickly.

      It sounds like his depression and mental illnesses has roots in his family
      background. Unfortunately, in many Muslim countries, these illnesses are
      not recognized as true illnesses and therefore appropriate treatment is
      not sought. The only thing you can do is to continue to point out to them
      that the religious treatment has not helped so far, and that there is no
      harm in trying something different. Make sure not to imply mental illness,
      because it would make them further resistant to seeking appropriate
      treatment. Instead, refer to the possibility of medical treatment and some
      medications that are now known to be effective in the treatments of such
      problems. Hope this helps.

      those children? What is the best treatment – besides the cessation of
      armed conflict? Jazakumallah khayran
    answer: >
      Sister Tahira: wa'alaikum assalaamu warahmatullah,

      It is loaded Question, but due to the time constraints, let me give you
      one of the solutions.

      PTSD symptoms are relieved easily with a supportive and understanding
      environment. If we, the Muslims, can provide some immediate love, care,
      understanding and security to these children, women and men, it may be of
      great help.

      I have been through a lot of mental & physical abuse over the last 4
      years. Basically my husband has been having an affair & every time I
      Question him, we argue & he ends up beating me. I lost a baby at 28wks & I
      blame my husband for this. We lost our house too over the last year. I
      gave birth to another baby, who was critically ill & stayed in hospital
      for 5months before I could take him home. All this is making me very
      depressed & now I sometimes get these thoughts in my head, that maybe its
      all my fault & Allah is punishing me for something I must have done in the
      past. At times I just want to end my life.

      I am alone most of the time at home with my baby & I feel my depression is
      affecting the way I care for my baby.

      An on-line counselor says I maybe suffering from Post Natal Depression. Is
      this possible as my baby is now 1yr old.

      Sister Yas:

      I am sorry to hear your plight. It seems to me that you have been
      suffering from depression and marital issues long before the baby came.

      You need help. Please seek it locally through a qualified counselor. The
      time is running out for this live dialogue, so I can't get into the
      details of your issues, but write to me at
      [www.shifa.ca](http://www.shifa.ca) if you need further help.

      Salam alaikum brother, May Allah keep, guide and bless you insha'Allah. I
      am revert to Islam of few months, alhamdulillah and I like to share that I
      suffered before very badly with depression, low self esteem and thoughts
      of suicide, since I become a Muslim, I still struggle but I find great
      grounding and strength in these matters, alhamdulilah for that. I
      understand Allah doesn't accept prayers of the insane as they are not
      accountable for their actions and so I trust Allah will deal justly with
      such. My enquiry is in relation to my mental health, not clinical, but a
      developed personality disorder as most have due to difficulty in staying
      true to our intended nature in this life. I see many missed opportunities
      in my life due to troubled childhood and how much I was incapable to
      achieve. I feel so frustrated and limited yet with gifts of many talents
      and good intellect. Every time I under achieve even though I am able to do
      well, but lack will, motivation, mainly as result of fear of more bad, and
      wondering what is the point? My father suffers with manic depression and
      paranoid schizophrenia, my mother depression. So far, I had 2 suicide in
      my immediate family and many attempts as well as self harm. Perhaps I am
      scared to push myself in case I cant cope. I don t know really what my
      Question is.. just, feeling very isolated, I tried many times to talk with
      other Muslims about my fears etc, but usually they don't understand…. I
      don't even know what they can tell me! I just wish I had a friend to share
      this with but I am now alone 24/7 because I find no one to relate to and I
      am building a "safe bubble" around myself. However, I also suffer from
      guilt sensations of what I can do to benefit others, yet I fail to do
      anything.. I really know this is not a counseling session but I know there
      is peace in Allah. However long our life is .. just keep true to Allah,
      till true peace will come, Insha'Allah..

      Thank you doctor for your Answer.. my son is 13 years old. My wife told me
      to tell you. In the summer we left our kid with a neighbor for one day.
      Anyways, when we picked him up the following day we were surprised to find
      our son playing with an Ouija board. We never thought anything of it but
      now this may hold some key to why our son is very different today.
    answer: >
      Yup. Keep digging and you may find more of what he has been doing. Then
      seek help for him. Good luck.

      Assalam alaikum.

      My brother is showing some symptoms of schizophrenia such as paranoia,
      isolation, bizarre thoughts. He is not working or going to school. He
      lives alone in Europe. He refuse to go to the doctor. He refuse to
      complete his documents, so he can go to Muslim country where he can see a
      Muslim specialist. This situation was going on for more than 10 years.
      Al-Hamdulillah my brother prays, fasts and recites Qur'an. He cut all the
      contact with his family. He is so angry with my parent because of horrible
      childhood experience they put him through. My father abandoned my brother
      in a third world country where he did not know any one. Now he hates my
      parents. He do not listen to any one. What can we do about this situation?

      Thanks for your Answer.
    answer: >
      Dear Sister, wa alaikum salaam

      He does need help. How is he managing by himself in Europe with such
      illness? He must have some ways he has developed to cope with this illness
      and survive. Ask him to get in touch with me if he likes, at
      [www.shifa.ca](http://www.shifa.ca). I can say much more at this time.

      Salaamu warahmatullahi wabarakatuh:

      I am Muslim living with a muslim wife form about eight years and now I am
      getting to dislike her very much. She is not a thinking person or a
      comfort to me except when I need sex real bad. I have a business and all
      she does is work. She has no ideas of her own. She would not say if my
      ideas are right or wrong. I would call her the slave with out a brain. She
      speaks a lot of bad things about me to her family. Her family is at war
      with her because she speaks bad things about me to them.

      Brother Malik: wa alaikum salaam

      It seems you need some individual counseling to help you evaluate your
      beliefs and attitudes towards marriage and marital life.

      You also need some marital counseling thereafter to help you both resolve
      the issues.

      Do you believe in receiving counseling? Do you believe there may be
      something wrong with you too that may need to be fixed? Think about it.

      anyone talking to me and the depression continues for days. I cant eat
      anything and what ever I eat I feel like I will vomit. No matter how hard
      I try to make my self happy I still end up in the same situation. What to
      do?

      Dear Naq: wa alaikum salaam

      Have you sought any treatment for your depression yet?

      There are some very effective medicines that would help control your
      depression, and then you can seek some counseling to learn to change your
      ways of thinking and your beliefs and attitudes about life.
