    answer: >
      Br. Hatim:


      Often, when someone calls another person stubborn, he means that the other
      person would not listen and agree with him. This is often the case between
      husbands and wives.


      True stubbornness is when someone knowingly, purposefully, with full
      awareness of him/her being wrong, chooses to stick with his opinion. In
      which case, the best solution is to state your opinion, and let it be. The
      more you would argue to convince the other person, the worst it would get.


      Hope this helps.

      Dear brother Kareem,


      Why is your wife’s younger sister living with you? Is this a long term
      arrangement or a short term?


      If it is just a short term issue, don’t worry too much, the problem would
      eventually go away.


      If it is a long term arrangement, you may want to discuss with your wife
      your feelings of being left out and your frustrations with the secrecies,
      and how it is negatively affecting the relationship between the two of
      you.


      Make sure to control your emotions and to stay focused on the issue
      without finger-pointing, blaming, and being sarcastic.


      Husband and wives, by the way, become very jealous for each other’s
      attention, and often find it difficult when the spouse shares the
      attention with a third person, sometimes even with children.
