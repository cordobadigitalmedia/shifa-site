  - question: What is the best way to deal with a stubborn wife?
    answer: >
      Br. Hatim: Often, when someone calls another person stubborn, he means
      that the other person would not listen and agree with him. This is often
      the case between husbands and wives. True stubbornness is when someone
      knowingly, purposefully, with full awareness of him/her being wrong,
      chooses to stick with his opinion. In which case, the best solution is to
      state your opinion, and let it be. The more you would argue to convince
      the other person, the worst it would get. Hope this helps.

      My wife is a lovely woman who has given me four children and we have been
      very close. Until recently when her younger sister came to leave with us
      she has changed and now hid everythickg she does from me but shearing
      everythickg with her sister. I feel neglected in the house and told her
      but she see nothickg wrong in that. I’m too jealous please advise.

      Dear brother Kareem, Why is your wife’s younger sister living with you? Is
      this a long term arrangement or a short term? If it is just a short term
      issue, don’t worry too much, the problem would eventually go away. If it
      is a long term arrangement, you may want to discuss with your wife your
      feelings of being left out and your frustrations with the secrecies, and
      how it is negatively affecting the relationship between the two of you.
      Make sure to control your emotions and to stay focused on the issue
      without finger-pointing, blaming, and being sarcastic. Husband and wives,
      by the way, become very jealous for each other’s attention, and often find
      it difficult when the spouse shares the attention with a third person,
      sometimes even with children.

      Assalamu`alykum Dr. Sadiq, my problem with my wife is that she does not
      listen to me at all. Whenever we talk about something, it is either black
      and white for her. Whenever I do something she does not like, she does not
      even ask why and how, she right away jumps to conclusion and most likely
      the answer is black. I tried many times to tell her that she should wait
      and ask why I am doing so and so, but she always gets upset and stops
      talking. I love my wife and she does love me, but this part does spoil
      sometimes love. Any suggestions?

      Dear Rami: Please do read my answer to the previous question.
      Communication skills and conflict resolution skills are essential in
      maintaining a good marital relationship. Unfortunately, we are not born
      with these skills; they must be learned. But, here are some tips for
      effective communication. 1. Don't rush to present your side. 2. Listen,
      listen, listen – without interrupting. 3. Acknowledge the message and the
      feelings behind the message by restating in your words what you heard and
      observed. 4. Empathize with the feelings, for example, "You are really
      upset." or angry or whatever. 5. Don't begin to talk to state your side
      until your wife has exhausted herself. 6. When it is your turn, state the
      facts, control your emotions, and be focused on the issue rather than
      proving yourself right or her wrong.

      7\. If you get interrupted, say, "May I finish, please"?

      8\. If it is a conflict, work together on finding a solution. etc.

      If you practice good communication skills, she would pick them up from you
      as well and Insha-Allah, things would get better.

  - question: >-
      As-Slamu`Alaykum, I recently got engaged. The problem is that we always
      tend to end up with disagreements over small issues. Mostly it has to do
      with Islamic rulings. I try to talk about something different but it ends
      in argument. I don't know what to do? Is it ok to have second thoughts
      about this person now? Or should I try to work this out somehow? I'm very
      confused even after doing istikharah. Your opinion would mean a lot to me.
      JazakAllah khair for you time.
    answer: >
      Wa \`Alaykum As-Salamu warahmatullah, Nabil:

      Do read my comments on the previous two questions.

      In any discussion, the husband and wife do not have to agree with each
      other. We are all different – we come from different backgrounds, family
      environments, values, lifestyles, levels of education and experience, etc.
      All of these influence the way a person thinks and behaves.

      Secondly, about religious matters, if there are disagreements, the best
      thing to do is to consult with authentic 'ulama (scholars) together to
      find out the correct ruling, rather than pushing for what each of you
      think is right.

      The more educated the spouses are, the more there would be arguments about
      what is right and wrong. This is because with education, people learn to
      think for themselves and think critically, and do not accept other
      opinions blindly.

      If you are of the type that cannot deal with disagreements effectively,
      and if your fiancé is of the type that she has an opinion on most things
      and must discuss everything before accepting it, both of you may want to
      discuss your future together.

      Hope this helps.

      As-Slamu`Alaykum, I find it difficult to forgive my husband for being a
      bit too friendly with other women, even when it is completely innocent. I
      will bring this up whenever we fight. He says that to him he is just being
      polite and in another case he said it is because the lady was making a
      spectacle of herself and he is just egging her on to see how far she would
      go. Also, it was also because we were at a gathering and I was paying too
      much attention to another lady friend and none to him. I do not like this
      kind of behavior as this is not what I expect of a husband. I used to be
      quite gregarious myself but toned myself down for his sake. Also we rarely
      see each other due to our careers, and this has made me distrust him even
      more. What can I do? Thank you in advance for your help.
    answer: >
      Dear Sara,

      Wa \`Alaykum As-Salamu warahmatullah.

      I think that you two rarely seeing each other due to your careers, may be
      one major reason for this type of behavior.

      Allah (SWT) created men and women and bound them in legitimate marital
      relationship so that they may enjoy peace, tranquility, and intimate
      closeness in each other's company to meet their emotional and intimate
      needs.

      Such close and intimate relationships also then prevent behaviors that you
      have described, and when they do occur they are easier to resolve.

      Secondly, acquiring the correct Islamic knowledge relevant to marital
      relationship and conduct between men and women who are non-mahram
      (strangers) to each other; and making a commitment to together practice it
      and hold each other accountable, would clear up most such behavior if two
      of you are sincere and practicing Muslims.

      Hope this helps.

      What should I do, I am very happy with my husband but he calls me most of
      the time with ugly names and I don't like it and he also talks bad about
      my parents and some times very bad things and when I say to him don't do
      that then he says if you don't like me to tell the truth go to them and
      take our son with you. Please help me and tell me what to do.
    answer: >
      Dear sister,

      How is that he calls you ugly names, talks bad about your parents, and
      threatens you to pack up and leave, but you are very happy with him? There
      is something wrong with this picture.

      Islamically and from a common human decency, he has no right to treat you
      this way, so why and for how long have you been putting up with this
      behavior?

      Remember, the longer you accept a wrong and unjust behavior, the more it
      becomes stronger.

      Tell him frankly and respectfully that this behavior of his bothers you,
      upsets you, because it is unfair and unjust, and that if he is not willing
      to stop it, you would have to rethink your relationship with him.

      Now do you think you are strong enough to take a stand on this? If not,
      you need help first.

      I always tell my husband not to get mad in front of kids as this might
      affect their emotions and make them think bad about us, but he likes to do
      it all the time; he even says sometimes "no, let them hear and see that
      you have done wrong" though we fight over minor issue. I want to seek your
      advice in two things:
        1. How can I make my husband talk without losing temper?
        2. How can we resolve issues privately while he doesn't care of letting kids know about our differences?
    answer: >
      Dear sister Aishah:

      It seems that you and your husband do not have a mutually respectful
      relationship. If he wants you expose your wrong-doings to your children,
      he is very vindictive person. If he is short-tempered on top, he may be
      even dangerous.

      This must stop, or you are looking at your children treating you the same
      way as they grow old.

      If he has a temper problem, and if he has no respect for you, I am afraid
      you may not be able to stop him from losing his temper. He would need
      help.

      Try to discuss with him these issues calmly, although the chances are that
      he would simply blame you for his temper.

      If he is not willing to look at the issue with self-responsibility, think
      of a possible separation for a while.

      And pray to Allah (SWT) for the him and for the best of your family. I
      pray for your well-being also.

  - question: >-
      I am married for about 4 years. We have a kid. But my heart is totally
      broken for the unlawful behavior of my wife. I am a Muslim and want to
      live accordingly. But my wife is a problematic person, the least I can say
      about her. The problem with her that she easily falls in love with men.
      Immediately after my marriage she fell in love with a married person who
      is a close relative of mine. I had to bear severe family problems for that
      and I became sick. Everyone of my family noticed that. Last year I went to
      a village where she fell in love with a non sophisticated guy. The problem
      with her that she makes eye contact with guys whom she like. This is very
      disturbing as the person may get a wrong signal. I am trying to rectify
      her. But how long can I keep barrier to her movement outside. I may be
      required to go in a western country very shortly for several years and my
      wife should accompany me. But there she may create more problems and may
      hinder my life. I have thought about divorce, but I love my kid very much.
      I think it is her psychological problem as her grooming up was not proper.
      I am a very creative man in my , but now totally frustrated, disheartened.
      Give me some suggestion in the Islamic way please.
    answer: >
      Dear Md.

      I am so sorry to hear your plight. If all what you say is correct, I am
      afraid she does need help. If she is not willing, you may legitimately
      think of leaving her, ensuring that your child is under your protection.
      Staying in this situation would ultimately lead to bigger and more
      dangerous consequences for you, her, and your child. May Allah guide you
      and her to do the right thing!

      will argue with and I don't like to be in a vute with anyone in my family

    answer: >
      What is his reason for asking you not to tell your mother about your
      pregnancy? If there is a legitimate reason, discuss it together. If not,
      just tell him that you cannot lie if your mother asked you; that you will
      not offer the information to your mother voluntarily, but if she asked,
      you would not lie.

      Hope this helps.

      As-Slamu`Alaykum, How can I explain to my wife that she's ordered to obey
      my commands? I always tell her that Islam works from a logical sense but
      the 'obeying' of one's husband doesn't make sense to her. How can I tell
      her that she has to listen to me?
    answer: >
      Dear El Haji, Wa \`Alaykum As-Salamu warahmatullah,

      Obedience to her husband is only mandated for a woman in Islam for as long
      as the husband is living his life Islamically, is just and fair with his
      wife, and is not asking her to do un-Islamic things, or ask her to do
      things which she finds intolerable. In this day and age, you will not
      enjoy blind obedience from your wife; and besides blind obedience of the
      husband is not even required of a wife in Islam, as I mentioned before.

      So, the best things to do to get her to obey you are:


      1. live your life by Islam;

      2. be a good role model of Islamic life style for your family;

      3. be kind and just to your family; and

      4. reform them where necessary with love, kindness and patience.
         Hope this helps.

      There are no hard and fast rules about this. It would often depend upon

      Could you explain the role that magic and Satan may have in causing
      conflict between a husband and a wife?
    answer: >
      Dear Sister Aisha:

      It is Satan's utmost mission to cause ruffles between a husband and a wife
      and to get them to fight with each other. Through this he ruins the whole
      families on both sides.

      Magic may and have been used to cause ruffles and fights between husband
      and wife. However, in most cases of marital problems I have seen, it is
      not magic as much as it is the husband and wife themselves, who are not
      willing to admit their weaknesses and roles in creating fights and
      problems.

      Hope this helps.

      This is oum o. reacting on the answer of the scholar I don't need help but
      the reason why I say that I am happy now is that when he says that things
      he says that he is saying the truth and he also says that he would do the
      same thing about even his own parents if he founds something bad on them
      he has all his life 30years now went to college to learn about Islam so he
      says that he knows perfectly better then anyone the Islam. If he says so
      am I a 21 years old women ho is born and raised in Belgium good enough to
      say otherwise.
    answer: >
      Dear sister:

      Even if he claims to always speak the truth when he is bad-mouthing your
      parents and calling you ugly name, it is not Islamically correct for him
      to so. Because Islam prohibits a person to bad-mouth another person, and
      especially behind their backs. It is considered a major sin. It is also
      not proper for him to call you bad and ugly names, because Islam prohibits
      this as well.

      So, if he has truly learned a lot of Islamic education, he should know
      these things and stop himself from such behavior.

      Your being 21 only does not make it ok for him to abuse you.

      Take care and May Allah help you.
