  The objective of these Web Lessons is to help you get to know yourself better,
  for knowing ourselves is the main key to knowing everything else.


  It is recommended that you study these lessons one at a time and not rush
  through them; and that you read them in the order they are presented here.


  After studying every lesson, give yourself time to ponder on it. Every lesson
  should motivate you to think, self-reflect, and increase your knowledge about
  yourself.


  You can always come back and study them again and again, for you are a
  treasury of secrets which would be revealed to you gradually as you think,
  self reflect, and learn to observe your true nature displaying itself in every
  thing you do.


  All the best in pursuit of becoming a self-aware person.
